  <h1>AI, DevOps, and the Future of Remote Systems</h1>
  <p><strong>February 11, 2026</strong></p>

  <!-- INTRO (Name + Company + Context) -->
  <p>
    I’m <strong>Sainath Mitalakar</strong>, Founder & CEO of
    <a href="https://www.t-matglobal.com/">T-Mat Global</a>.
    As we build a remote-first technology company operating across continents,
    one thing is becoming clear: AI and DevOps are no longer support functions —
    they are the operating system of modern organizations.
  </p>

  <!-- CORE INSIGHT -->
  <p>
    Remote teams scale only when systems replace supervision.
    AI accelerates decisions.
    DevOps enforces consistency.
    Together, they define how modern companies operate without proximity.
  </p>

  <h2>Why AI and DevOps Are Converging</h2>

  <p>
    AI optimizes decisions.
    DevOps operationalizes them.
    In global remote setups, this convergence removes friction,
    reduces dependency on individuals,
    and creates resilient execution at scale.
  </p>

  <h2>Building Systems Instead of Managing People</h2>

  <p>
    At <a href="https://www.t-matglobal.com/">T-Mat Global</a>,
    we focus on designing systems that enable autonomy,
    accountability, and reliability —
    regardless of geography or time zone.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the future of work:
    system-driven, automation-first, and globally distributed.
  </p>
